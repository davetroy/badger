	<p>Dear <%=@badge.firstname%>,</p>
	
    <p class="intro">
		TEDxMidAtlantic 2012 is a wrap. Over 40 speakers, 1,000 attendees, 100 volunteers, and 20+ fearless event partners created an extraordinary two days of memories, connections, and ideas.
    </p>
	
	<p>We hope you enjoyed it! We have a few pieces of housekeeping for you.</p>
	
	<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHZLellQcU5DeU1EeFJlTzJvbWZxckE6MA">Please take this short survey</a> about TEDxMidAtlantic 2012: Be Fearless.</strong> We would love to know more about what you thought about each of our speakers and presenters so we can make improvements for next year.</p>
	
	<p><strong>We had some program changes.</strong> Unfortunately, four presenters we had planned to feature had last-minute scheduling or medical emergencies that precluded their participation. We'll be inviting Neil Strauss, Kyra Maya Phillips, Noor Siddiqui, and Melody Barnes back for our next event. With over 40 speakers scheduled, we expected a few unavoidable changes.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Thank you to our core organizing team.</strong> While TEDxMidAtlantic is a broad community effort, a handful of people did an incredible amount of work &mdash; tirelessly and for the love of the cause. Special thanks to Kate Ahern, Allyson Burns, Jean Case, Steve Case, Nate Mook, Matt Koll, Laryssa Kundanmal, Amy Genevieve Kozak, James Pan, Sarge Salman, Anna Slomovic, Michael Smith, Elizabeth Terrell, Jennifer Troy, Sheryl Winarick, and Emily Yu.</p>
		
	<p><strong>Please join me in thanking James Pan for our beautiful badges, program, title slides, and session introduction videos.</strong> James contributed his design skills to create a unified set of print and digital materials for TEDxMidAtlantic 2012 that truly elevated the quality of the event. He also contributed to curation of both music and speakers. Thank you, James!</p>
	
	<p><strong>Videos will be available soon.</strong> Our friends at <a href="http://www.blueskyfilms.com">Blue Sky Films</a> will start work on editing footage from the event right away and we should start posting videos online in the next few weeks. We do ask for your patience as we have over 40 talks to edit and it's a lot of work. We'll let you know when they're ready to view and share!</p>
